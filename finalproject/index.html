                    Our teachers offer classes both in-person and virtually. We do
                    this to help ensure our students get the help they need. The
                    student will also have access to our virtual classroom in Canvas.
                    This will allow our students the ability to access songs, videos,
                    books, announcements and other assigned material. They will also be able to
                    access their teacher's virutal office on zoom. The student will also
                    be able to contact their teacher via canvas message, email, and the ability
                    to text or call their teacher anytime during the week. Learn more about
                    what we offer at our academy by sending us a message or give us a call!

                <p class="homeparagraph3">
                    Here at L&C Music Academy we like to have fun! Twice a year during the Spring
                    and Fall our staff will hold some fun concerts for the students to show what
                    they have learned. The concerts are not mandatory but are highly encouraged by
                    our teachers. The details of the concert will be given by the teachers at the
                    appropriate time. Each student will have sufficient time to practice and feel
                    comforatable with each of their songs.
