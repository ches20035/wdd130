                <p class="aboutparagraph1">
                    David Chesley, the founder of L&C Music Academy began teaching his first lesson in the year of 2015,
                    just after he came home from serving an LDS mission. His first lesson took place in the small town
                    of Wellsville, just south of Logan in the state of Utah. He orginally called the business "David
                    Chesley Music Lessons". The business soon took off, and has since grown considerably. A year later,
                    David met the love of his life, and began dating. A year later, he proposed to her and was married a
                    few months later. It wasn't until then, that the small academy went through some drastic changes.
                    The academy began to offer wide variety of lessons, including: guitar, ukulele, voice, and piano.
                    The academy also offered lessons both in person and a new online option. The name was later changed
                    to L&C Music Academy.</p>
                <p class="aboutparagraph2">
                    David also offered something that very few teachers would ever consider. He would travel to his
                    students homes. This made his business stand out from the crowd. This allowed some flexibity for his
                    studnets and the parents that were involved. Another unique tool that the academy has to offer is
                    the ability to access the classroom materials, such as songs, lesson plans, video tutorials, and
                    other activities through the Google Classroom platform. The classroom was later changed to what
                    David believed was a better solution, the academy upgraded to the Canvas platform. The platform is
                    very similar to Google classroom but offers more tools within it that would help the studnet and
                    teacher stay connected. So what are you waiting for? Register for a free trial with L&C Music
