    Our Purpose
    <ul>
        <li>Are you interested in learning a new instrument? Do you have a child or another family member that you would
            like to enroll in a class? I have created a website that will allow you to find your new instrument and
            begin classes today. It is easy to navigate and find an instructor that will best fit you or your family
            members needs. You will also be able to access many other resources such as songs and video tutorials.
    </ul>

        <li>Introduce our business to as many people as possible in order to enroll students into our music classes.
