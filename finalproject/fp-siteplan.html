    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>David Chesley, the founder of L&C Music Academy began teaching his first lesson in the year of 2015, just after he
    came home from serving an LDS mission. His first lesson took place in the small town of Wellsville, just south of Logan
    in the state of Utah. He orginally called the business "David Chesley Music Lessons". The business soon took off, 
    and has since grown considerably. A year later, David met the love of his life, and began dating. A year later, he proposed
    to her and was married a few months later. It wasn't until then, that the small academy went through some drastic changes. 
    The academy began to offer wide variety of lessons, including: guitar, ukulele, voice, and piano. The academy also offered
    lessons both in person and a new online option. The name was later changed to L&C Music Academy.</p>

    <p>David also offered something that very few teachers would ever consider. He would travel to his students homes. This made his 
    business stand out from the crowd. This allowed some flexibity for his studnets and the parents that were involved. Another
    unique tool that the academy has to offer is the ability to access the classroom materials, such as songs, lesson plans, video
    tutorials, and other activities through the Google Classroom platform. The classroom was later changed to what David believed
    was a better solution, the academy upgraded to the Canvas platform. The platform is very similar to Google classroom but offers
    more tools within it that would help the studnet and teacher stay connected. So what are you waiting for? Register for a free
    trial with L&C Music Acacemy today and see for yourself why so many people are switching to our academy!</p>
